I am trying to make flasky (https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/flasky) work with AWS OpsWorks by following the tutorials below:

1. https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-serve-flask-applications-with-gunicorn-and-nginx-on-ubuntu-14-04
2. http://kronosapiens.github.io/blog/2015/11/10/opsworks-flask-and-chef.html

Lots of code in this repo is based on the following one:
https://github.com/kronosapiens/chef-repo

For the basic setup for the first tutorial, see README at https://github.com/harrywang/flask-gunicorn-nginx

Note to make Flasky working locally:
